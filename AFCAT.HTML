        <br><b>Stage I of the AFSB Interview</b><br>
        A screening test is the first stage of an AFSB interview. It is held on the first day of the candidate's arrival at the AFSB center and consists of two tests. They are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Officer Intelligence Rating (OIR) Examination</li>
            <li>Picture Perception and Discussion Test (PPDT)</li>
            <li>Officer Intelligence Rating (CIR) Test â€“ During the OIR Test, candidates must illustrate their Quantitative Ability and Logical Reasoning Ability in a test administered at an AFSB center.</li>
            <li>Picture Perception and Discussion Test (PPDT) - The PPDT is divided into two sections:
            <ol>
                <li>Picture Perception and Discussion: Aspirants are shown a picture on the screen for a short time and then asked to recognize the main characters and form a short story focused on the picture.</li>
                <li>Group Discussion: Candidates must discuss their story and conclude a group discussion in the second part.</li>
            </ol></li>
        </ul>
        The stage results are announced shortly after both tests are completed. Candidates who pass Stage I must stay behind and appear for Stage II of the AFSB Interview. Applicants who do not qualify or are screened out must return to the testing centers.
